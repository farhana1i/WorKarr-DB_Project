# WorKarr

WorKarr is a Pakistani online marketplace for freelance services founded by a team of 3 individuals at FAST-NUCES Lahore. The website provides a platform for freelancers to offer services to customers worldwide.
It was our Database Course project. Fortunately, we got full marks in the project and appreciation from our course lab instructor.

## Technologies
I have used HTML5, SCSS, JS/JQuery for the graphical user interface. C#, ASP.NET, JS/JQuery has been used for implementing backend functionalities. SQL/TSQL - for the database. Chart.JS - for displaying summary charts. Ajax - to avoid the headache of page refresh.
