        </p><h3>Seller Features</h3>

        <p>WorKarr Sellers have access to several exclusive features that help customize the way their services can be offered.</p>

        <h4>Custom Offer</h4>

        <ul>
  <li>Sellers can also send Custom Offers addressing specific requirements of a Buyer.</li>
  <li>Custom Offers are defined by the Seller with the exact description of the service, the price and the time expected to deliver the service.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


        <h4>Subscription</h4>

  <li>A WorKarr Studio allows certain Sellers to collaborate with each other and offer Buyers a multi-service Gig (a "Studio Gig").</li>
  <li>Studio Lead: Certain selected Sellers may lead and operate WorKarr Studios as Studio Leads. Studio Leads are chosen manually by WorKarr editors through an ongoing review process based on seniority, volume of sales, high ratings, exceptional customer care, high order completion rate and more. The Studio Lead is responsible for inviting all Studio Members and managing all incoming Orders, from communicating with the Buyer, through handling any required revisions and until the final delivery. The Studio Lead can also remove Studio Members from Studio Gigs at any time. With respect to open Orders, however, Studio Members can be removed by Customer Support only.</li>
  <li>Studio Members: A Studio Lead can invite other Sellers who were also chosen by WorKarr to be eligible for Studios collaboration (each, a "Studio Member") to join their Studio Gig and be assigned to a specific service. Studio Members can ask to be removed from a Studio Gig at any time.</li>
  <li>Studio Gigs: A Studio Gig provides a bundle of services (from two services and up to five) within one Gig. A Studio Gig’s minimum price is US$100. As Studio Gig is comprised of several services, every service includes its own pricing, pricing factors, and a Studio Member / Lead  that is accountable for such service, all of which is defined by the Studio Lead when creating the Studio Gig. WorKarr Studios may also offer Custom Offers.</li>
  <li>Limitations: Each WorKarr Studio has one Studio Lead. Similarly, a Studio Lead may not operate more than one WorKarr Studio.

  <li>Studio Gig Reviews: Studio Gig Buyers are able to leave a public review on the Studio Gig as if it were a regular Gig. The public buying rating &amp; review is linked to and visible on the Studio Gig page, the WorKarr Studio itself (studio page), as well as all Studio Members and Studio Lead of that WorKarr Studio.</li>
</ul>


        <h4>WorKarr Anywhere</h4>

        <ul>
  <li>WorKarr Anywhere is a feature that allows Sellers to send Custom Offers outside of WorKarr.</li>

  <li>We encourage our Buyers and Sellers to try and settle conflicts amongst themselves. If for any reason this fails after using the Resolution Center or if you encounter non-permitted usage on the Site, users can contact WorKarr's Customer Support department for assistance <a href="http://support.WorKarr.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

A milestone will be automatically marked as complete if no acceptance or request for modification were submitted within 8 days after marked as Delivered, however, in such case the Order will be stopped and all further milestones will not start. Once a milestone is delivered and accepted, Buyers may choose to either continue with the Order and pay for the next milestone, or to stop the Order.

Buyer may also cancel future Orders under the Subscription before payment is made for such future Orders. Once payment is made, WorKarr’s Order Cancelation policy under the <a href="/content/payments-terms-and-conditions" target="_blank">Payments Terms</a> will apply.

        <h3>Handling Orders</h3>

        <ul>
  <li>When a Buyer orders a Gig, the Seller is notified by email as well as notifications on the site while logged into the account.</li>
  <li>Sellers are required to meet the delivery time they specified when creating their Gigs. Failing to do so will allow the Buyer to cancel the Order when an Order is marked as late and may harm the Seller's status.</li>
  <li>Sellers must send completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Completed Work button (located on the Order page) to mark the Order as Delivered.</li>
  <li>Users are responsible for scanning all transferred files for viruses and malware. WorKarr will not be held responsible for any damages which might occur due to site usage, use of content or files transferred.</li>
  <li>Buyers may use the "Request Revisions" feature located on the Order Page while an Order is marked as Delivered if the delivered materials do not match the Seller's description on their Gig page or they do not match the requirements sent to the Seller at the beginning of the order process.</li>
</ul>


        <h3>Reviews</h3>

        <ul>
  <li>Feedback reviews provided by Buyers while completing an Order are an essential part of WorKarr's rating system. Reviews demonstrate the Buyer's overall experience with the Sellers and their service. Buyers are encouraged to communicate to the Seller any concerns experienced during their active order in regards to the service provided by the Seller.</li>
  <li>Leaving a Buyer's feedback is a basic prerogative of a Buyer. Feedback reviews will not be removed unless there are clear violations of our Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards.</li>
  <li>To prevent any misuse of our Feedback system, all feedback reviews must come from legitimate sales executed exclusively through the WorKarr platform from users within our Community. Purchases arranged, determined to artificially enhance Seller ratings, or to abuse the WorKarr platform with purchases from additional accounts, will result in a permanent suspension of all related accounts.</li>
  <li>Feedback comments given by Buyers are publicly displayed on a Seller’s Gig page.</li>
  <li>Work Samples are the delivered images and videos sent to a Buyer in a delivery message. Work Samples are added to a Seller's Live Portfolio on their Gig page if the Buyer chooses to publish the Work Sample while providing a public feedback review.</li>
  <li>Withholding the delivery of services, files, or information required to complete the Gig’s service with the intent to gain favorable reviews or additional services is prohibited.</li>
  <li>Responding and posting a review: Once work is delivered, the Buyer has three days to respond. If no response is provided within the response period, the Order will be considered completed.</li>
  <li>Users are allowed to leave reviews on Orders up to 10 days after an Order is marked as complete. No new reviews may be added to an Order after 10 days.</li>
  <li>Sellers may not solicit the removal of feedback reviews from their Buyers through mutual cancellations.</li>
  <li>Feedback reviews are unavailable for orders made through the Logo Maker.</li>

        <p>Ownership and limitations: When purchasing a Gig on WorKarr, unless clearly stated otherwise on the Seller's Gig page/description, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, copyright in the work delivered from the Seller, and the Seller waives any and all moral rights therein. Accordingly, the Seller expressly assigns to the Buyer the copyright in the delivered work.

Some Gigs (including for custom created work) charge additional payments (through Gig Extras) for a Commercial Use License. This means that if you purchase the Gig for personal use, you will own all rights you require for such use, and will not need the Commercial Use License.
